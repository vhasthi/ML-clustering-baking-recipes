    "How does a recipe define a food item? What makes a cake a cake? In this project, we seek to cluster recipes based on their ingredients and other variables, and determine whether a machine learning model can distinguish recipes with regard to the type of food item that the recipe is supposed to describe. To narrow the scope of the problem, we will be focusing on baked goods, and attempting to cluster the data by type of baked good (e.g. cakes, cookies, muffins, etc). The data we will be using is a set of recipes, with each recipe including a title, set of ingredients (with associated quantities), and set of instructions. Data will be extracted from the ingredients and instructions, and will be fed into a gaussian mixture model (GMM) or other clustering scheme. We will measure success via the efficacy of the clustering algorithms and their accuracy when it comes to separating the recipes into the correct category."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, recipes are sets of instructions for the purpose of preparing specific dishes. They generally include some information about the dish, the ingredients used in making the dish, and how to assemble or process those ingredients. In particular, baked goods are dishes (such as cookies, cakes, etc) that contain flour as a primary ingredient and involve combining ingredients to make a batter which is placed into an oven to bake. The consistency of the baked good generally depends on the proportions of flour, egg, sugar, butter, and baking powder used in the batter, and on how long and at what temperature it is baked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recipe datasets have previously been used in machine learning research. Often, the research is not particularly focused on recipes, but uses them for their advantageous qualities (most recipes share a similar structure, they can be easily scraped from websites, they can't be copyrighted, etc). For example, a 2017 paper by Yang et al.<a name=\"yang\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#yangnote) used machine learning to analyze \"reference expressions\" (phrases that refer to previously mentioned objects in a text) and employed instructions from recipes as an example of this. Other published works are more explicitly food-focused; Herranz et al.<a name=\"herranz\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#herranznote) provides an overview of techniques that can be applied to recipes, ingredient lists, and even images of food. The paper associated with the RecipeNLG dataset by Bien et al.<a name=\"recipenlg\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#recipenlgnote) also provides an overview of previous efforts in machine learning on recipes, including the two aforementioned papers.\n"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem at hand is the categorization of baked-goods recipes based on their ingredients and instructions. Though they are not explicitly numerical, these attributes have aspects that can be abstracted into numbers; specifically, the quantities of each ingredient, their ratios to each other, and the temperature and duration of baking. Each recipe can thus be expressed as a vector, and clustering techniques (such as GMM or hierarchical clustering) can be applied to the dataset to sort the recipes into groups. We can measure the success of the clustering by comparing the predicted labels to the true labels found in the original dataset. "

    "\n",
    "The total size of the dataset is 2,231,141 recipes. We'll be using a subset consisting of specific recipes for types of baked goods; one possible subset would be recipes for cakes, cookies, and muffins, and between the three of those there are 237,715 recipes in the dataset. Variables we can use are quantities of flour, milk, sugar, egg, butter/oil, and baking powder; these quantities could be absolute or relative (to the quantity of flour, e.g.). We could also use baking temperature and baking duration as additional variables. We should have at least 7 variables to work with.\n",

    "\n",
    "### what some critical variables are, how they are represented\n",
    "\n",
    "The ingredient quantity variables can be represented as absolute quantities (e.g. grams/cups/teaspoons) or proportions to the amount of flour (unitless, assuming that that quantity is expressed in the same unit as flour). Temperature can be measured in degrees fahrenheit or centigrade, and baking duration will be measured in minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### any special handling, transformations, cleaning, etc will be needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Ingredient lists are currently stored as lists of strings, so those will need to be processed to obtain quantities of ingredients as numbers. If ingredient quantities are listed in different units (e.g. cups, grams), we will need to make sure that we pay attention to which units are being used and convert all quantities of a particular ingredient to the same unit (same for temperature). Baking temperature and duration will have to be extracted from recipe instructions, which are also stored as lists of strings. This part might be difficult and may even require rejecting recipes for which we canâ€™t easily extract this information."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to implement GMM clustering to categorize recipes based on vectors representing ingredients and their respective quantities. For variables lacking quantity information we will use binary values to indicate the presence of ingredients. Data preprocessing will be implemented to ensure that all vectors can be compared in a consistent manner. Implementation will be carried forward using python libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. Testing will occur through some sort of training and test set based on the categorization of previous known recipes, which ensures that the performance of the clustering algorithm is evaluated on unseen data. To measure the success of the clustering, we plan on utilizing the Rand and adjusted Rand index values to evaluate the similarity between the predicted recipe clusters and the true recipe labels. This solution can work because it effectively recognizes the patterns that exist in the ingredients and the amount of ingredients used through GMM, and the preprocessing will make sure that the input to the GMM is properly selected and formatted. Thus, only relevant information is being used to categorize the recipes.   "

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a clustering problem, the natural evaluation metrics are the Rand index and Adjusted Rand index. The Rand index is a metric used to evaluate how similar two groups of items are, with the score ranging between 0 and 1. The Adjusted Rand index is similar to the Rand index, but adds in a normalization component that accounts for the possibility that two groups of items are similar due to random chance alone. We would use the Rand index and the Adjusted Rand index to determine how close the GMM clustering of recipes are to the actual true labels found in the original data. Should both the Rand index and Adjusted Rand index score be close to 1, we could determine that our GMM clustering method has accurately found the true label in the original dataset, and perhaps use it on future unseen recipe datasets."
